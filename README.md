A simple webpage using NodeJS and Express framework

Building a simple website using the NodeJS and Express framework. 
•	Created a new repository in GitHub.
•	Cloned the empty repository to my local folder using the git clone command.

•	Developed the web page in the HTML file. 
•	To run this in the local host I used the command – node server.js
•	The webpage was hosted in the local host port 3000.
